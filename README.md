![stratagy](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c8f094f-46cf-44c2-af46-ee540ccb3c90)

- For this project, I created a simple project to demonstrate the strategy pattern.

- I have an abstract scriptable object named “SkillStrategy.” We can diversify its contents.

- I have three skills;
  * Rage
  * Shield
  * Slash.
- They are currently performing the same actions, but it is sufficient for us to understand the logic.
